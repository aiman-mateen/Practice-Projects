            <h4>Everest(8,848.86 m) - The Highest Mountain in the World </h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Mount Everest (or Chomolungma) is not just the highest peak in the world, but a true legend among climbers.</li>
                <li> Its height of 8848.86 meters makes it the king of the Himalayas.</li>
                <li>Climbing Everest is a very difficult task that requires months of preparation, acclimatization and endurance.</li>
                <li>Despite this, hundreds of desperate people try to conquer this peak every year, overcoming extreme weather conditions, oxygen starvation and exhaustion.</li>
            </ul>

        <div class="k2-desc">
            <h4>K2 (8611 m)</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>K2, or Chegori, is second only to Everest in height, but is significantly more difficult to climb.</li>
                <li>It is the second highest mountain in the world, but it is unforgiving.</li>
                <li>The mountain is located in the Karakoram, on the border between Pakistan and China.</li>
                <li>K2 is famous for its technically difficult routes and harsh weather conditions, making it one of the most dangerous peaks in the world.</li>

            <h4>kanchenjunga (8586 m)</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Kanchenjunga is located on the border between Nepal and India.</li>
                <li>It  is the third highest mountain in the world. Its name translates as “Five Treasures of the Great Snow” as it consists of five main peaks.</li>
                <li>Unlike other eight-thousanders, this peak is less popular among commercial expeditions, which makes it attractive to real adventurers.</li>
                <li>Kangchenjunga is famous for its unpredictable avalanches and difficult weather conditions.</li>

            <h4>Lhotse (8516 m)</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Lhotse is Everest’s neighbor, located just a few kilometers away. </li>
                <li>It often remains in the shadow of its giant brother, but is no less challenging to climb.</li>
                <li>The main route to the summit follows the same route as Everest, up to the South Col, after which climbers turn east.</li>
                <li>One of Lhotse’s unique features is its south face, one of the most difficult and dangerous to climb in the world.</li>
