            <h4>Makalu (8 485 m)</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Makala is located only 19 km from Everest, but it is much less popular due to difficult access and technical difficulties.</li>
                <li>It has a pyramidal shape and looks very impressive against the backdrop of the Himalayas.</li>
                <li>Climbing Makalu requires excellent physical fitness, as the routes here are very steep, with narrow ridges and icy slopes.</li>
                <li>The summit was one of the last to be conquered among the eight-thousanders, as it was long considered too difficult to climb.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Cho-Oyu (8188 m)</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Cho Oyu, which translates as “Turquoise Goddess,” is the sixth-highest mountain in the world.</li>
                <li>It is located on the border of Nepal and Tibet, about 20 km west of Everest.</li>
                <li>Due to its relatively flat terrain and relatively stable weather, Cho Oyu is considered one of the “easiest” eight-thousanders to climb, making it a popular choice among beginner climbers.</li>
                <li>The first successful ascent to the summit was made by an Austrian expedition in 1954.</li>

                <li>Nanga Parbat – is the ninth highest mountain in the world, located in Pakistan</li>
                <li>It is known as one of the most dangerous mountains to climb due to its extremely difficult weather conditions and high fatality rate among climbers. </li>
                <li>This feature has earned the mountain the nickname “Killer Mountain”.</li>
