            <h4>Annapurna I (8 091 m)</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Annapurna I is the tenth highest mountain on the planet, but its mortality rate among climbers is higher than that of Everest</li>
                <li>It is the first peak above 8,000 meters to be conquered by man – a French expedition successfully climbed it back in 1950.</li>
                <li>Despite this, the mountain is considered extremely dangerous due to frequent avalanches and difficult routes.</li>
                <li>Many climbers try to avoid Annapurna due to the high risk of death, but there is another way to enjoy its beauty – trekking around Annapurna.</li>

            <h4>Dhaulagiri (8 167 m)</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Dhaulagiri, which means “White Mountain” in Sanskrit, is located in central Nepal.</li>
                <li>t is one of the most picturesque peaks in the Himalayas, and its massive snow-capped slopes and glaciers create a stunning landscape</li>
                <li>At the same time, Dhaulagiri is known as one of the most difficult mountains to climb due to its steep routes, harsh weather conditions, and frequent avalanches.</li>
                <li>The first success in conquering this peak was in 1960, thanks to an international team of climbers.</li>
